After downloading the package, see 1_BCS70_how_to_run.do for more details. All data are available from the UK Data Service after registration, creating and account, a project, 
and asking for permission at wwww.ukdataservice.ac.uk. If you have any questions, contact me on a.adamecz-volgyi at ucl.ac.uk.

There are five folders in the package: three are empty and should accomodate the raw data ('rawdata'), the data files generated by the do files (once they are run) ('data'), 
and the results ('results'). Two folders have content: 'do' contains the do files and 'logs' contain the logs of our own last running. The new log files will be saved under different names and could be compared to the original ones.

If you use these files please cite our latest publication.
